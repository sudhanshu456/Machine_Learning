>The wreck of the RMS Titanic was one of the worst shipwrecks in history, and is certainly the most well-known.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.  This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and lead to better safety regulations for ships.

>One of the reasons that the shipwreck lead to such loss of life is that were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.  Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, like women, children, and the upper-class.

>In this contest, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive.  In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of Machine Learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
